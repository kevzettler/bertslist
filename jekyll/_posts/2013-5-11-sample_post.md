# Hubot stops by for tea
A perfect way to end the week - We've had awesome feedback and contributions from everyone using [Kandan](cloudfuji.com/blog/2012/05/07/launching_cloudfuji.html), both on and off [Cloudfuji](http://cloudfuji.com). One of the biggest requests we've had is for robotic companionship - that is, [Hubot](https://github.com/blog/968-say-hello-to-hubot) integration.

So we went out and did it.

## Introducing Hubot-Kandan

Hubot is an awesome, extensible chatbot from Github. We wanted to make getting Hubot into your Kandan as seamless as running Kandan itself, so we've put together a repo that's easily deployable just by copy/pasting and filling in your app details. And you can still extend it with whatever hubot scripts you'd like!

[Check it out the README](https://github.com/cloudfuji/hubot-kandan-app) to get your own instance up and running.
